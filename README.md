# BlackJack_with_a_Twist_Console
BlackJack with a Twist is a simple card game developed for a school assessment. The primair assessment was to develop a cardgame 
were the following:

- Give up the number of players
- Give up how many cards each player should take
- Create cards
- Create a carddeck and shuffle this deck
- Show the cards the player has taken and show the hand of the player

Thereby I was free to develop an own game if there was enough time. I've decided to develop a very simple BlackJack game.

Features:

- Enter the number of players which will be involved in the game
- Create a single deck of cards and take a random card of this deck
- Option menu to buy a card, to stand, to check your own cards and to check the cards of the bank
- Give each player an amount of cards, based on an input number for each player
- Show the cards that have been drawn from the deck and remove the drawn card from the deck
- Check the first two cards before the game starts for an blackjack
- A reset method to replay the game and add more players
- Buy chips and place a bet in a pot.
- Pay out an price or pay out the pot to the bank if there are no winners.
